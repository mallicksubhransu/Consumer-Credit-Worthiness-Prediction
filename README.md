## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict consumer credit worthiness based on various features and evaluate the performance of different classification models in making accurate predictions. The project is structured into several phases, each with specific tasks and objectives.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is [insert dataset name here]. It contains information about [describe dataset contents and features]. You can download the dataset [provide a link if available] or use your own dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
In this phase, we explore the dataset to gain insights into the data distribution, relationships between variables, and potential patterns. This step helps us understand the data better and formulate initial hypotheses about the relationships between features and the target variable.

## Data Quality Checking
Data quality is essential for building reliable models. This phase involves checking for missing values, data inconsistencies, and outliers. Any issues found will be addressed to ensure the data is clean and suitable for modeling.

## Hypothesis Validation
The hypotheses formulated during exploratory data analysis will be validated through statistical tests and visualizations. This step helps us confirm or reject our initial assumptions about the data.

## Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
Data preprocessing involves preparing the data for modeling. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and more. Feature engineering aims to create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.

## Feature Selection
Selecting the most relevant features is crucial for model efficiency and interpretability. Various feature selection techniques will be applied to identify the subset of features that contribute the most to the prediction task.

## Classification Models
We will train and evaluate the following classification models:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XG Boost
- AdaBoost
- KNeighbors
- Naïve Bayes
- Support Vector Machine

Each model will be trained and evaluated using stratified 5-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalization of the results.
